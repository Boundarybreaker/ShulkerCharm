SkulkerCharm is a mod that adds limited-range creative-style flight in survival mode. A Shulker Charm is crafted with two shulker shells, two feathers, and an elytra, and is worn in the `head/necklace` trinket slot. As long as you're in range of a beacon, the charm will charge at a rate of 40 points of energy per second, per beacon you're in range of. When flying, the charm will drain 20 points of energy per second. When you run out of energy, the charm will cut off your flight and give you slow fall for a few seconds to gently drift back to the ground.
